I created this application so beginners can test their knowledge in Python. It starts with a prompt in which you need to enter a topic (Loops, Strings, or Lists), and click generate question. In each topic, there are three questions.
So when you will encounter the 1st question and choose an answer, you will get a message at the bottom saying if your answer was correct or not. In the event that your answer is wrong, you can also toggle between the options to fix your answer. You can also do that even if your answer is correct.
You can then click generate question again so it gives you another question from the topic. If you want to switch your topic, go back to the field, and write another topic, and you will get questions pertaining to it.

I hope you enjoy my application, should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. And if you have any recommendations on how I can improve my application, do let me know!
